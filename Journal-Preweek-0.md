Hypothesis and Technical Uncertainty
Hypothesis: AI-powered teaching assistants can help students translate English to Japanese by providing guidance instead of direct answers. Their effectiveness improves when tasks are divided into smaller subtasks, and they are useful for prototyping before full platform integration. Technical Uncertainty: Does using an AI-Powered Assistant make for a good place to rapidly prototype agents?

Technical Exploration
1. Start Simple: First, we’d use an AI-powered assistant to help with a broad task like guiding students to translate English into Japanese, just to see how well it works. 2. Break It Down: Next, we’d try splitting this big task into smaller ones, like focusing on grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, to see if that helps the AI do a better job. 3. Test and Improve: We’d use the assistant to quickly test and improve different ways of guiding the students, making changes based on feedback. 4. Set Up for Integration: Once we have something that works, we’d figure out how to connect this assistant to a bigger platform so it can work as part of the full system. 5. Refine Prompts: While working with the assistant, we’d experiment with prompting to make it give better, more helpful answers. 6. Keep Learning: We’d keep an eye on how the assistant performs and look for any cool new techniques or tricks that work especially well with this kind of AI, adjusting as needed depending on our resources.
Briefly describe the path of technical exploration during these projects.

Final Outcomes
1. Authenticity: Using Japanese characters (漢字/かな) makes the learning experience feel more real and immersive. 2. Clarity and Focus: A concise approach, like Claude's, helps students stay engaged and grasp key concepts faster by avoiding unnecessary introductions. 3. Student Discovery: The best AI outputs encourage learning through clues, allowing students to figure out grammar patterns on their own instead of simply providing the answers. 4. Simplified Sentence Structures: Using simpler, conceptual sentence structures (e.g., [Object] [Request], [Subject] [State]) helps students focus on core ideas without overwhelming them with complex grammar details. 5. Engagement and Progression: Organizing material in a logical sequence, as Meta AI does, allows students to move from easy to harder concepts while keeping them interested and avoiding overload. 6. Tailored Clues for Engagement: AI that offers detailed clues, like ChatGPT, encourages deeper engagement by prompting students to think critically and apply what they’ve learned.
