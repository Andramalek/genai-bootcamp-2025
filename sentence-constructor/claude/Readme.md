## Which Model

Claude Sonnet 3.5 (2025 Q1)

I have the paid version of Claude Sonnet, and we're going to use projects.

## Prompting Guides

https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview

Anthropic has very specific suggestions for providing good prompting.

## Initial Prompt

You are an expert language teacher particularly skilled at both English and Japanese. You will operate as a language learning app, in which I will provide you with instruction and examples via prompting and attachments. Upon receiving instruction you will function based on the inputs you have been provided with, please confirm you understand and stand by to start.

## Follow-up Prompt

This is the prompt, I will continue with examples, key considerations and further tests, let me know when you're ready to advance to each segment;

## Prompt Reinforcement

Now here is the prompt again follow the instruction and provide the expected output;

## Test Sentence

Can I please have a glass of water? I am very thirsty.


## Initial Output

I'll help you construct these sentences in Japanese. Let's break this down:
First, here's the vocabulary you'll need:
JapaneseRomanjiEnglish水mizuwaterコップkoppuglass (drinking)のどnodothroat渇くkawakuto be thirstyくださいkudasaiplease (polite)
Sentence Structure:

First sentence: [Object] + を + ください
Second sentence: [State/Condition] + です

Clues and Considerations:

For the first sentence, think about how to politely ask for something in Japanese
For "glass of water," consider the order: "water of glass" is more natural in Japanese
When expressing a state like being thirsty, remember to use です at the end
Think about which particle would connect 水 and コップ
For "very thirsty," you can use とても to express "very"
The polite form of kawaku (to be thirsty) changes to kawakimasu

Would you like to try constructing these sentences? Start with either one, and I'll help guide you!

## Initial Observations

This output effectively does too much of the work for the student, reducing learning opportunities and potentially creating dependency on romanji rather than proper Japanese characters.

## Secondary Output

JapaneseRomanjiEnglish水mizuwaterコップkoppuglass欲しいhoshiiwantとてもtotemovery喉が渇くnodogakawakuthirsty
Sentence Structure:
[Object] [Request], [Subject] [State]
Clues and Considerations:

When making a polite request in Japanese, consider how to make it more formal
Think about which particles connect nouns together (like "glass of water")
For expressing a state of being, consider what ending to use
Remember in Japanese, the object usually comes before the verb
Think about how to express "I" in this context - is it necessary?

Would you like to try constructing these sentences? Or would you like specific clues about any part?

## Secondary Observations

The second output is significantly better for learners:

It's more focused and concise - gets straight to the learning material without unnecessary introduction.
The sentence structure is simpler and more conceptual ([Object] [Request], [Subject] [State]) without giving away grammar points like particles (を, です) that students should figure out.
The clues are more strategic - they encourage thinking about grammar concepts without revealing specific conjugations or forms. 
It follows the "show, don't tell" principle, letting students discover the grammar patterns rather than explicitly stating them.
It matches more closely with the scoring criteria shown in the examples, where simpler, less prescriptive guidance scored higher.
