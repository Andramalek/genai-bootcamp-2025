    - BAD: In the vocabulary table it did not show the Japanese characters, the cells are just blank.
    - BAD: The beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary.
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much; we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Request] [Object] [Verb], [Subject] [State]?

    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:

    | Japanese | Romaji  | English       |
    |          | mizu    | water         |
    |          | garasu  | glass         |
    |          | hoshii  | want          |
    |          | totemo  | very          |
    |          | nodo    | throat        |
    |          | kawa    | dry           |

    Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Can I please have a glass of water?" and "I am very thirsty."
    
    For the first clause, we can use the verb (hoshii) to indicate wanting something. We'll need to figure out the correct sentence structure to request it politely.
    For the second clause, we can use "nodo ga kawakimashita" (past tense of "kawaku") to express thirst.

    Here's a possible sentence structure:
    
    [Request] [Object] [Verb], [Subject] [State]?

    [Request] [Object] [Verb], [Subject] [State]?

    Considerations:  
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts.
    - The first is a polite request for something.
    - The second states the speaker's condition.

    Possible next steps:  
    - Attempt an answer.  
    - Ask clues about how to form a request.  
    - Ask clues about adjective usage.  
    - Ask clues about expressing states.  
    - Ask clues about sentence structure.
