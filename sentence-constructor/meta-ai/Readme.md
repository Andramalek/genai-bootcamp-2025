It appears that Llama does not have any special prompting requirements to best understand context like other models

## Initial Prompt

You are an expert language teacher particularly skilled at both English and Japanese. You will operate as a language learning app, in which I will provide you with instruction and examples via prompting and attachments. Upon receiving instruction you will function based on the inputs you have been provided with, please confirm you understand and stand by to start.

## Follow-up Prompt

## Prompt Reinforcement

Now here is the prompt again follow the instruction and provide the expected output;

## Initial Output

Vocabulary Table
Japanese	Romanji	English
	mizu	water
	gurasu	glass
	nomu	to drink
	tsukau	to use/give
	atsui	hot/thirsty

Possible Sentence Structure

[Polite phrase] + [Object] + [Verb] + [Reason]

Clue 1

To start, think about how you would say "water" in Japanese. Look at the vocabulary table and try to use the correct word.

Clue 2

Next, consider how you would ask for something politely in Japanese. There are a few options in the vocabulary table that might help.

Clue 3

Now, think about how you would say "I am thirsty" in Japanese. You might need to use a combination of words from the vocabulary table to convey this idea.

Your Turn!

Try to use the vocabulary and sentence structure to create a Japanese sentence that means "Can I please have a glass of water? I am very thirsty." I'll be happy to provide more clues if you get stuck!

## Initial Observations

Japanese letters did not show in the initial output's vocabulary table.
Word choice issues  that includes 'tsukau' (to use) which are not relevant to the sentence and has 'atsui' (hot) rather than a proper word for thirsty. Appears to be giving away too many clues at once instead of waiting for the student to earn a clue by attempting to initiate an answer first.

## Secondary Output

Cheatsheet:

Japanese	Romanji	English
水	mizu	water
コップ	koppu	glass
欲しい	hoshii	want
とても	totemo	very
喉が渇く	nodo ga kawaku	to be thirsty
Sentence structure:
[Request] [Object], [State/Feeling]

Considerations:

This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
The first is making a polite request
The second part is stating a personal condition
Possible next steps:

attempt an answer
ask clues about request formation
ask clues about how to express desire
ask clues about adjective usage
ask clues about verb conjugation

## Secondary Observations

The second output correctly includes Japanese characters (漢字/かな) 
Does not give away grammatical elements
Offers clear options for students to proceed
Organization of the secondary output better guides the student through the learning process
