Clues and Considerations
For the first part of the sentence ("Can I please have a glass of water?"), think about how to say "water" and "glass" together. Use the word for "please" to make it polite.

The verb for "want" in Japanese is often expressed as an adjective. Use the word for "want" from the vocabulary table.

For the second part of the sentence ("I am very thirsty"), think about how to describe your throat being dry. Use the word for "throat" and the verb for "to be dry."

Use "very" to emphasize how thirsty you are.

Remember to use particles to connect the words correctly. For example, the particle for marking the object of a sentence is often を.

If you make an attempt, I will interpret your sentence and provide feedback on what you said versus what you intended to say. Let me know when you're ready!

## Initial Observations

- Vocabulary Table
Irrelevant Words: It includes 欲しい (hoshii), which means "want" and is not directly relevant to the student's input ("Can I please have a glass of water? I am very thirsty.").

Missing Key Phrases: It does not include 〜てもいいですか？, which is essential for constructing "Can I ~?" questions.

- Misses Key Points: It does not explain how to express thirst in Japanese (e.g., 喉が渇いている), which is crucial for the student's input.

## Secondary Output

Vocabulary Table
English	Japanese (Kanji)	Japanese (Kana)	Romaji
Can I ~ ?	〜てもいいですか？	〜てもいいですか？	~temo ii desu ka?
Please	お願いします	おねがいします	onegai shimasu
Glass (cup)	コップ	コップ	koppu
Water	水	みず	mizu
I	私	わたし	watashi
Very	とても	とても	totemo
Thirsty	喉が渇く	のどがかわく	nodo ga kawaku
Sentence Structure
(Item) をください or (Item) をお願いします → Asking for something politely.

(Verb) てもいいですか？ → Asking for permission.

(Subject) は (Adjective/State) です → Describing one's condition.

Clues and Considerations
Start by constructing a request for a glass of water. You can use 「〜をください」 or 「〜をお願いします」 to ask politely.

If you want to ask "Can I have...?", you might use 「〜てもいいですか？」 instead.

To express thirst, think about how "thirsty" works in Japanese. Instead of saying "I am thirsty" directly, Japanese often describe it as "My throat is dry" (喉が渇いている).

Use とても to emphasize how thirsty you are.

The correct verb form is needed for "thirsty" because it is an action in Japanese, not an adjective.

Encouragement
Give it a try! 😊 I'll check your sentence and guide you if needed.

## Secondary Observations

The secondary output is much better than the initial output. It excludes uneccessary words, provides specific sentence structures, more detailed clues and encourages better engagement from the student in my observation.
